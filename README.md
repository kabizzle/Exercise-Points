# Exercise Points Project

Programming project for ELEC-A7100 Basic course in C programming (Spring 2022)

I implemented a system that tracks the exercise points for a course. 

The system is required to store:

- student number (string of 6 characters or less)
- first name (string of arbitrary length)
- last name (string of arbitrary length)

The program contains:

- Add command - adds new student to database
- Update points command - updates exercise round points of a student
- Print database command - displays the database content
- Save to file command - saves the database to a text file
- Load from file command - loads students from a text file saved using Save to file command
- Quit program command - releases all allocated memory and exits the program
